A picture from one of my favorite places.  Bonus points if you can find it on a map.

### Short Version

I work at Princeton University as the Director of *Research Software
Engineering for Computational & Data Science* in the [Research Computing
Department](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu).  Basically that
means I lead the
[Research Software Engineering Group](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/software-engineering).

I'm heavily involved in the [US-RSE Assocation](https://us-rse.org)
currently serving as the chair of the founding steering committee.  

I have a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from University of
Pennsylvania.  An M.S. from Syracuse University, also in Mechanical
Engineering and a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from University
of Delaware.  It took me a while, but eventually came to the
conclusion that I like writing code more than I liked the science or
engineering.

I have [3 terrific daughters](/assets/images/Cruise-2019.jpg) who keep life
entertaining, fulfilling, and exhausting. I like good food (and spending too
much at Michelin starred restaurants), audiobooks, lifting weights, and the
[Philadelphia Eagles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDXSvWK0Dco).

### Long Version

Maybe coming soon (as a blog post)...
