Note to self: put a better picture here.

### Short Version

I work at Princeton University as the Manager of *HPC Software
Engineering and Performance Tunining* in the [Research Computing
Department](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu).  Basically that
means I lead the Research Software Engineering Group.

I'm heavily involved in the [US-RSE Assocation](https://us-rse.org)
currently serving as one of the founding steering committee members.  

I have a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from University of
Pennsylvania.  A M.S. from Syracuse Univerity, also in Mechcanical
Engineering and a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from University
of Delaware.  It took me a while, but eventually came to the
conclusion that I like writing code more than I liked the science or
engineering.

I have 3 terrfic kids who keep life entertainging, fufulling, and
exhausting. I like good food (and spending too much at Michelan
starred resturants), audiobooks, and lifting weights.

### Long Version

Coming soon (as a blog post)...
