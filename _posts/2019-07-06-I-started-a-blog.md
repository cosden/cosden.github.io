I don't know what came over me, but I decided to start a blog!  

Were people beating my door down for my opinion on everything?  

*No.*  

Were people clamoring for a peak inside my life and mind?

*Not a chance.*

Am I having narcissistic tendencies with the need to share every thought I've ever had.  

*Gosh I hope not, but we're probably getting closer!*

In all honesty, I don't know where this will go.  I've never been much
of a writer or journaler.  However with the recent involvement getting the [US-RSE
Association](https://us-rse.org) going, I find myself
thinking, reflecting, and wanted to share my thoughts.  So this is
most likely going to be a professional blog.  Not that I don't have opinions on
things outside of work. Here are a couple that always get me going:

- **Why do weather forecasters
insist on reporting relative humidity?** If only there was a logical,
useful measure of humidity we could all understand!  Oh wait, there is,
it's the dew point!  None of this "feels like" garbage.  Someone
picked a completely arbitrary dew point as the norm and based
everything off of that.  In the northeast it's never that dry, so it's
never an accurate "feels like."  

- **Why do people always insist on
putting the utensils and napkins at the front of a buffet line?**  I
don't know what I'm getting so I don't know what I'll need. Invariably
I'll end up needing a knife, not have one, and have to apologize as I
try to reach in and grab one.  Not to mention, now I have to carry the
utensils the whole way through the buffet line or put them in my
pocket?

See what I mean? No one wants to hear my random rantings and
ravings.  I could literally write a book on first-world problems and
complaints.  Hey, maybe you want to hear this things...if you do let
me know.  Poke me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/iancosden) and
maybe from time to time I'll put something in.  More likely, if I
venture off reservation it'll be to drop a review about a good book I
recently listened to on audible (I'm an avid audiobook listener).

The smart money is on my sticking with this for a few weeks
(months?) and then it sitting stale, never getting updated until
eventually I pull the plug, embarrassed and pretending it never
happened.
