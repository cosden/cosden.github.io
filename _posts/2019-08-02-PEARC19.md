I just returned from PEARC19 in beautiful Chicago.  I've never been to
Chicago in the winter, so my impressions are only based on literally
perfect summer weather - but what an awesome city.

I made the trip to PEARC19 with a fairly singular focus: advertise and
promote the [US-RSE](https://us-rse.org).  I brought 2,000 US-RSE
stickers ([note to self, don't bring that many on an airplane
again](https://twitter.com/IanCosden/status/1155591056827830272)). 

more later...
